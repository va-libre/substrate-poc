A Liquidity Provider is the main participant of the VLN, it attests having certain asset and lets the network manage it on its behalf.
An asset can be on-chain or of-chain, the former is automatically managed only requiring a confirmations for transfers from the provider if dessired, with the later the network would ask the participant to complete a set of actions and keep the network updated with the status of any external transactions.
