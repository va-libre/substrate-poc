# Human Swap Pallet

Swaps that require human interaction(potentially automated on the human side), these humans(liquidity providers) are willing to exchange their own assets at a rate often higher than that of a configured price oracle, where one of the assets in the trading pair is a foreign(off-chain) asset, meaning that its completion depends on real world actions that when confirmed release the scrowed funds of the on-chain asset being traded.
